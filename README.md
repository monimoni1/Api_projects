# Api_projects

These are just a few projects I have played around with to get more comfortable with APIs and how they work. 

## Notes:
- Full form of API: Application Programming Interface. Literally calling information from the web using requests.get()
- Though APIs provide a powerful way to supercharge your program, there are some limitations that have been hard for me to get over:
    - There are rate limits on API calls, so most public websites won't give you that many calls per unit of time.
    - Sometimes, pulling an API request takes time. So most of the time I don't even know if the problem is with my code, or if it's the API response time that's slow.
    - Some of the most important information on a website are either not available to parse or require API keys or OAuth tokens. :,)
    - God forbid there are changes in the website you are parsing your data from, the whole code will break down. I think they call it deprecated code.
